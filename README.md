# R-Data-Manipulation
R code that prepares raw behavioral data for analysis
rtfull_data is a folder that contains datasets that consist of finger responses and its reaction time, recorded throughout the trials, by row.

There are five blocks with 210 trials in each.

Variable "note" is the finger movement that subjects are asked to perform. i.e. 1000 is pressing with the little finger; 1100 for the little & ring finger; 1111 for all fingers except the thumb.

I am interested in all pairwise reaction time when going from one movement to another. The rts are to be mapped on a dissimilarity matrix for furthur analysis.

behavioral.csv is an example of the responses
